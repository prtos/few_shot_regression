    "### Summary\n",
    "In this experiement, we compare MetaKRR single kernel (SK) with MetaKRR multi kernel (MK) using the meta-dataset easy harmonics (Only 2 harmonic with a fixed frequence, only phases and amplitude are varied).\n",
    "We also explore different versions of MK to determine what is the best way to condition on a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's $z$ be the task representation. \n",
    "Three alternatives were explored to get $z$ herein:\n",
    "- task_descr: predefined task descriptor given by the data distribution that generates the task. For example, in esaytoy, the task descriptor is the set of the phases and the amplitudes of the 2 harmonics.\n",
    "- train_data: $z$ is obtained by encoding of the training set of each episode/task using a neural network. The architecture of this is a 3 stage attention network followed by an average pooling layer\n",
    "- both: a combination of the aboves through a concatenation\n",
    "\n",
    "Three methods were considered to adapt the shared feature extractor $\\phi(x)$ to each task/episode:\n",
    "+ fusion net $f(\\phi(x), z) = MLP([\\phi(x); z])$; where $[\\cdot; \\cdot]$ means the concatenation of the vectors and $MLP$ is  a fully connected multi-layer neural network (which output dimension is the same as $\\phi$ output dim).\n",
    "+ gated modulation: $f(\\phi(x), z) = \\phi(x) \\odot \\sigma(z) $; where $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication and $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid activation function\n",
    "+ Film modulation: $f(\\phi(x), z) = FiLM(\\phi(x), z) $, where FiLM is a Feature-wise Linear Modulation proposed [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07871.pdf)"
